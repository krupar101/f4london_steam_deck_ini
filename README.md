This repository was created to support the installation process of Fallout London conversion mod on Steam Deck.
It is strictly related to instructions in this reddit thread:
https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout4london/comments/1ebrc74/steam_deck_instructions/

It is also used to perform some testing activities of the Overkill automated script for the steam deck before I update it in the official repo:
